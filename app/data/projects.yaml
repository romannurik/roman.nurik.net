  description: |
    I'm currently a design lead and manager on the Firebase UX team, focusing on the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com) design system (components, spec documentation, Sketch UI kit) and other platform-level design and UX engineering projects.

    Previously, I was UX lead for [Firebase Remote Config](https://firebase.google.com/products/remote-config/), [A/B Testing](https://firebase.google.com/docs/remote-config/abtest-config), the console onboarding experience, our UI prototyping system, the [Firebase plugin for Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/firebase.html), and other smaller projects.

- name: Muzei Live Wallpaper
  date: September 2013 – February 2014
  tags: featured
  description: |
    My philosophy for design and developer advocacy is to [create big, real-world demos](https://medium.com/google-developers/walk-then-talk-3b935bfe5484) and use them as fodder for content creation; walking the walk gives you more credibility.

    Muzei is one of the larger apps I've written that epitomizes this philosophy. I [came up with the idea for the app](https://medium.com/google-developers/serendipitous-ideas-3a1721a6f716), designed, developed, launched, and open-sourced it over the course of 4 months.

    Since the original launch, I updated some of the custom visual language in the app to include material design elements.

    Muzei has been installed over a million times on Google Play.

- name: Google I/O Android App
  date: 2010 – 2014
  tags: featured
  description: |
    The Google I/O Android app is a Developer Relations-run project that serves two purposes:

    * Help Google I/O attendees and remote viewers personalize their conference agenda and explore conference content before, during, and after the event.
    * Be an excellent open-source example of Android design and development best practices

    My role has primarily been lead designer and frontend engineer, most notably for the 2014 app, which was one of the very **first Android apps to adopt material design**. For two years, I was also the overall technical lead for the app. In 2015, I acted primarily as UX mentor/advisor.

    caption: The 2011 app was one of the first to support the new tablet form factor with multi-pane UIs.

- name: DashClock Widget
  date: September 2012 – February 2013
  description: |
    DashClock was my first published Android app and is exemplary of my philosophy for [design and developer advocacy](https://medium.com/google-developers/walk-then-talk-3b935bfe5484). It also promotes Android by exemplifying functionality that's only available on the Android platform.

    I updated the app for material design shortly after the material launch at Google I/O 2014.

    DashClock has been installed over 3 million times.

- name: Design Tools
  description: |
    One of my biggest passions is creating designer and developer tools. Since 2010, I've worked on a number of small and large, mostly web-based tools that help designers and developers be more productive.

    This gallery showcases some of my proudest design tooling side projects.

  pages:
  - video: tools_sketch_artboard_tricks
    color: '#F1F1F1'
    color2: 'material teal 500'
    caption: "Like many other designers, I've switched to using Sketch for most of my UI work. In my unrelenting quest to improve my own productivity, I started writing Sketch plugins. [Sketch Artboard Tricks](https://github.com/romannurik/sketch-artboardtricks) is one that I wrote that many designers on my current team now use."

    device_frame: browser_light
    caption: The [Android Icon Animator](https://github.com/romannurik/AndroidIconAnimator/) was a foray into motion design tooling, and the genesis for the new and awesome [Shape Shifter](https://shapeshifter.design/) tool by Alex Lockwood. Built with [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/).

  - video: tools_assetstudio
    color: 'material light-blue 100'
    color2: '#0099CC'
    device_frame: browser_light
    caption: The [Android Asset Studio](https://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/) was one of the first tools I wrote, aiming to take the guesswork out of Android app icon sizing and effects. Plug in some values and it generates all the necessary assets for each screen density.

    caption: The [Layer Visualizer](https://github.com/romannurik/LayerVisualizer) was a quick tool I built for helping [teach material design](https://www.udacity.com/course/material-design-for-android-developers--ud862), specifically the depth relationships of material surfaces.

    caption: "[Android Design Preview](https://github.com/romannurik/AndroidDesignPreview) is a tool I co-wrote that allows designers to get a more realistic view of their UIs by mirroring a portion of their computer screen to an Android device."

  - video: tools_ninepatch
    color: 'material light-blue 100'
    color2: '#0099CC'
    device_frame: browser_light
    caption: Nine-patches are notoriously tedious to produce, especially in bulk. I built the [nine-patch generator](http://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/nine-patches.html), to simplify the process of creating optimized nine-patches for all densities.

    color2: '#6ab344'
    device_frame: browser_light
    caption: I recognized several years ago that developers were using device frames inconsistently, with poor lighting/sheen, shadows, etc. I decided to make an easy-to-use [generator](http://developer.android.com/distribute/tools/promote/device-art.html) for Nexus device-framed images.

- name: Material Product Icons

  description: |
    I’ve created a number of product icons following the [material design guidelines](https://www.google.com/design/spec/style/icons.html), for a number of purposes, including official Google products such as [Google Cloud Messaging](https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/), as well as unofficial apps such as [Nick Butcher](http://twitter.com/crafty)’s [Plaid](https://dribbble.com/shots/2344334-Plaid-Product-Icon).

    The gallery showcases a sampling of the icons I’ve worked on.

- name: FORM Type Maker & Watch Face
  date: October 2014
  description: |
    In addition to my strategy work for our [FORM conference](https://design.google.com/form-2014/) (which I co-created), I built a web-based playground for the brand's display typeface (created by the material team). The desktop and mobile web app let users type a message, choose a color, and created an [animated GIF to share on social media](https://twitter.com/tanyawuethrich/status/534276313537052672).

    Because the conference was invite-only and very small, the playground was a **key part of the social media strategy for the event**, ensuring that those who couldn't attend could still participate in the conversation.

    I designed and developed the app, building a `<canvas>`-based glyph animation framework in the process. This project was a great exercise in creative technology for me, and I learned a ton about modern web animation, performance, and more along the way.

    Finally, I built an Android Wear watch face based on the font, and helped [integrate it with Muzei](https://medium.com/google-developers/only-on-android-45ff04d5722e).
