    I'm currently a design lead and manager on the Firebase UX team, overseeing:
    
    - The "[Build](https://firebase.google.com/products-build)" products (databases, web hosting, authentication, etc.)
    - Core platform primitives (onboarding, billing, navigation, etc.)
    - The [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com) design system and brand visual language

    Previously, I was an IC UX lead for [Remote Config](https://firebase.google.com/products/remote-config/), [A/B Testing](https://firebase.google.com/docs/remote-config/abtest-config), and designed much of the current console onboarding experience.

- name: Styleguide
  date: 2019 – Present
  tags: featured web
  description: |
    The Firebase team was using an old, clunky publishing system for documenting the "best practices" side of our design system. After considering alternatives available at the time (from [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), to Google Docs, to a one-off site), I decided to build something new.

    Styleguide is a spec publishing system built with React focuses on rapid publishing and easy maintenance, including features like:

    - Markdown-based authoring + layout language, extensible through plugins
    - Drag+drop or paste an image from the clipoard to upload.
    - Simple collaboration + author management
    - Robust redirect and shortlink support

    I'm hoping to open source it someday.

        The tool extends Markdown heavily with side-by-side layouts and other block types.

- name: MaterialColorsApp
  date: 2016 – Present
  tags: featured desktop
  description: |
    I built a tiny [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) app that lets you quickly reference the original Material Design color palettes. This was useful in the early days while our team used Sketch (which didn't have color styles), and remains useful for apps like Google Slides and Keynote.

    Over time more functionality was added, including dark mode support, fuzzy hex-code search (contributed by a colleague), and the [hidden] ability to bring in custom colors.

- name: SlidesCodeHighlighter
  date: 2017
  tags: featured web
  description: |
    I used to do a lot of public speaking about tech (partiucularly Android), and a persistent issue was quickly highlighting code for use in decks. I wrote a tool to help with that, complete with custom themes, support for lots of languages, etc.

    A more recent innovation was “highlight mode,” which was great for walking through different parts of the code across several slides.

- name: ProtoKit
  date: 2019
  tags: web
  description: |
      As part of exploring a couple design system ideas my Firebase UX team was throwing around, I built a set of web components with [StencilJS](https://stenciljs.com/) that made simple HTML-based prototyping really approachable (just drop a script tag and start prototyping!)

      Hoping to open source these, or at least write more about the process, someday.

  pages:
  - video: protokit-playground
    color: '#385574'
    device_frame: browser_light
    caption: |
        The playground was an interactive editor for playing with and quickly visualizing ProtoKit's web components.

  - video: protokit-tokens
    color: '#6B829D'
    device_frame: browser_light
    caption: |
        I was particularly excited by this exploration into documenting color tokens. Particularly since semantic colors varied across 2 dimensions (theme, container type).

- name: DataURL.app
  date: December 2020
  tags: web
  description: |
    I wrote a little app that helps you make data URLs quickly.

    It was an opportunity to try out Firebase Hosting Preview URLs, but also solved a painpoint I
    frequently experienced as a developer.

- name: Muzei Live Wallpaper for Android
  date: 2013
  tags: android web
  description: |
    My philosophy for design and developer advocacy is to [create big, real-world demos](https://medium.com/google-developers/walk-then-talk-3b935bfe5484) and use them as fodder for content creation; walking the walk gives you more credibility.

    Muzei is one of the larger apps I've written that epitomizes this philosophy. I [came up with the idea for the app](https://medium.com/google-developers/serendipitous-ideas-3a1721a6f716), designed, developed, launched, and open-sourced it over the course of 4 months.

    Since the original launch, I updated some of the custom visual language in the app to include material design elements.

    Muzei has been installed over a million times on Google Play.

- name: Google I/O Android App
  date: 2010 – 2014
  tags: android
  description: |
    The Google I/O Android app is a Developer Relations-run project that serves two purposes:

    * Help Google I/O attendees and remote viewers personalize their conference agenda and explore conference content before, during, and after the event.
    * Be an excellent open-source example of Android design and development best practices

    My role has primarily been lead designer and frontend engineer, most notably for the 2014 app, which was **one of the very first Android apps to adopt material design**. For two years, I was also the overall technical lead for the app. In 2015, I acted primarily as UX mentor/advisor.

- name: DashClock Widget for Android
  date: 2012
  tags: android
  description: |
    DashClock was my first published Android app and is exemplary of my philosophy for [design and developer advocacy](https://medium.com/google-developers/walk-then-talk-3b935bfe5484). It also promotes Android by exemplifying functionality that's only available on the Android platform.

    I updated the app for material design shortly after the material launch at Google I/O 2014.

    DashClock has been installed over 3 million times.

- name: Design Tools
  tags: tools plugins
  description: |
    One of my biggest passions is creating designer and developer tools. Since 2010, I've worked on a number of small and large, mostly web-based tools that help designers and developers be more productive.

    This gallery showcases some of my proudest design tooling side projects.

    caption: |
        Like many other designers, I've switched to using Sketch for most of my UI work. In my unrelenting quest to improve my own productivity, I started writing Sketch plugins. [Sketch Artboard Tricks](https://github.com/romannurik/sketch-artboardtricks) is one that I wrote that many designers on my current team now use.

        The [Android Asset Studio](https://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/) was one of the first tools I wrote, aiming to take the guesswork out of Android app icon sizing and effects. Plug in some values and it generates all the necessary assets for each screen density.

- name: FORM Type Maker and Wear OS app
  date: 2014
  tags: web
  description: |
    I cofounded [FORM](https://design.google.com/form-2014/), Google's first external design conference. I also built a web-based playground for FORM's custom typeface (created by the Material team). The app lets users type a message, choose a color, and create an [animated GIF to share on social media](https://twitter.com/tanyawuethrich/status/534276313537052672).

    Due to the conference's small size, the app was a key part of the social media strategy, ensuring those who couldn't attend could still participate.

    I built a `<canvas>`-based glyph animation framework for the app. It was a great exercise in creative technology, and I learned a ton about modern web animation, performance, and more.
