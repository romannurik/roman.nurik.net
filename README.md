This is the source code to my personal site, [roman.nurik.net](http://roman.nurik.net) and [project listing](http://roman.nurik.net/projects/).

To build the site (which gets output in the `dist` directory), just run

    $ npm install
    $ npm run build

You can also run the local web server with:

    $ npm start
